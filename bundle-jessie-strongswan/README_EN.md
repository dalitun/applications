# 5 Minutes Stacks, episode 16 : Strongswan VPN Tunnel #

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Episode 16 : Strongswan

![Strongswan logo](img/strongswan.png)

StrongSwan is an implementation of IPSec protocol under the GPL license. It was born by a fork of the FreeS/WAN project. The project was launched in 2005 with the goal of building a stable IPSec platform with X.509 extension.

What we will see in this episode will allow you to set up an IPSec tunnel with a minimum of steps in order to get a secure and authenticated tunnel to an external area of the Cloudwatt platform.

## Preparations

### The version

* Debian Jessie
* Strongswan 5.2.1

### The prerequisites to deploy this stack

* Internet access
* A Linux shell
* A [Cloudwatt account](https://www.cloudwatt.com/cockpit/#/create-contact) with a [valid keypair](https://console.cloudwatt.com/project/access_and_security/?tab=access_security_tabs__keypairs_tab)
* The tools of the trade: [OpenStack CLI](http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/install_clients.html)
* A local clone of the [Cloudwatt applications](https://github.com/cloudwatt/applications) git repository

### By the way...

If you do not like command lines, you can go directly to the "run it thru the console" section or "run it by the 1-clic" section by clicking [here](#console). 

## What will you find in the repository

Once you have cloned the github repository, you will find in the `bundle-jessie-strongswan/` directory:

* `bundle-jessie-strongswan.heat.yml` : Heat orchestration template. It will be use to deploy the necessary infrastructure.

## Démarrage

### Initialize the environment

Log in to the [Cloudwatt Console](https://console.cloudwatt.com) and

Have your Cloudwatt username and password ready and click [download a 'Cloudwatt API' credentials script](https://console.cloudwatt.com/project/access_and_security/api_access/openrc/).
With it, you will be able to wield the amazing powers of the OpenStack APIs.

Source the downloaded file in your shell (enter your password when prompted) to begin using the OpenStack clients.

~~~ bash
$ source COMPUTE-[...]-openrc.sh
Please enter your OpenStack Password:

~~~

Only then can the Openstack command-line tools interact with your Cloudwatt user account.

### Adjust the parameters

The stack that we are proposing requires some input parameters to be used:

* `keypair_name` : The keypair name that will be injected into the server to allow your connection
* `local_cidr` : The CIDR of the private subnetwork which will be deployed by the stack (ex: 192.168.47.0/24). This should be a [classe C](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_d'adresse_IP) network.
* `partner_cidr` : The CIDR of the private subnetwork which exist at the other side of the IPSec tunnel (ex: 192.168.58.0/24). This should be a [classe C](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_d'adresse_IP) network.
* `preshared_key` : The secret string character that is shared between the 2 sides of the IPsec tunnel. This secret will be injected into the server that will be started by the stack but is not stored on the Cloudwatt plateform.

### Start-up

For this exemple, we will use these parameter values:

* `keypair_name` : "my_key.pem"
* `local_cidr` : "192.168.47.0/24"
* `partner_cidr` : "10.0.240.0/24"
* `preshared_key` : "pr3ttyh4rd4nd0ngs3cr3tstr1ngsharedw1thmyb|_|ddy"

Use the `-P` option of the heat client to pass the parameters into our stack:

~~~
$ heat stack-create BATMAN -f bundle-jessie-strongswan.heat.yml \
  -Pkeypair_name="my_key.pem"       \
  -Plocal_cidr="192.168.47.0/24"    \
  -Ppartner_cidr="10.0.240.0/24"    \
  -Ppreshared_key="pr3ttyh4rd4nd0ngs3cr3tstr1ngsharedw1thmyb|_|ddy"

### The light at the end of the tunnel

To complete the installation, you should *have in hand the public IP adress of the other side of the tunnel*.
Considering that the target server is configured correctly and wait only for your inputs, the procedure is confined to:

* connect in SHH to your server
* move to root via `sudo -i`
* run the command:

```
ipsec_post_install $ADDRESS_IP_PUBLIC_OF_THE_OTHER_SIDE_OF-THE_TUNNEL
```

Of course, this assumes that the other extremity is a server already parametered with the shared secret, knows the CIDR of your private zone and is on-line.

Once all these conditions fulfilled:

* the server of the stack, which hosts Strongswan, can contact all the machines of the subnet on the other side of the tunnel.
* whatever server started in the subnet of our stack can contact whatever machines of the subnet on the other side of the tunnel.

### Ready to play?

If you do not have a partner to test the tunnel, nothing prevents you to play with Strongswan by starting a second stack (which we could call ROBIN example) by reversing the values of local_cidr and partner_cidr and make the post-installation of each of the stacks with the value of the floating IP assigned to the other one.

* Start a BATMAN stack as described above
* Get its floating IP
* Start a ROBIN stack as described above (with the same preshared_key)
* Get its floating IP
* Perform the BATMAN post-install with the ROBIN IP address
* Perform the ROBIN post-install with the BATMAN IP address

You will get then 2 totaly isolated network silos which can communicate thru the crypted tunnel.

## That's fine but...

### You do not have a way to run the stack thru the console?

Lucky for you then, all of the setup for Strongswan can be accomplished using only the web-interface.

1.	Upload directly [the stack file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudwatt/applications/master/bundle-jessie-strongswan/bundle-jessie-strongswan.heat.yml).
2.  Go to the «[Stacks](https://console.cloudwatt.com/project/stacks/)» section of the console
3.	Click on «Launch stack», then «Template file» and select the file you just saved to your PC, and finally click on «NEXT»
4.	Name your stack in the «Stack name» field
5.	Fill up the other parameters of the formular
6.  Perform the post-configuration tasks as described above (no escape this time, you will need to access thru SSH).

### Or an easier way thru a 1-click?

... Yes! Go to the [Apps page](https://www.cloudwatt.com/en/applications/index.html) on the Cloudwatt website, choose the apps, press "DEPLOY" and follow the simple steps... 5 minutes later, a green button appears... ACCESS: you have nearly your Strongswan! (but, no escape this time, you will need to access thru SSH)

## So watt?

The goal of this tutorial is to accelerate your start. At this point **you** are the master of the stack.

If your want to have a closer look at the Strongswan configuration, you can start by:

* `/etc/ipsec.conf`: configuration file of thr Strongswan connections
* `/etc/ipsec.secrets`: Strongswan secrets storage file

Have fun. Hack in peace.
