## Episode 32 : MySQL

![mysql](img/mysql.png)

MySQL is a freely available open source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL).

SQL is the most popular language for adding, accessing and managing content in a database. It is most noted for its quick processing, proven reliability, ease and flexibility of use. MySQL is an essential part of almost every open source PHP application. Good examples for PHP/MySQL-based scripts are phpBB, osCommerce and Joomla.

One of the most important things about using MySQL is to have a MySQL specialized host. Here are some of the things SiteGround is proud of:

## Preparations

### The version
  - CoreOS Stable 1010.6
  - Docker 1.10.3
  - MySQL 5.7

### The prerequisites to deploy this stack

   These should be routine by now:

  * Internet access
  * A Linux shell
  * A [Cloudwatt account](https://www.cloudwatt.com/cockpit/#/create-contact) with a [valid keypair](https://console.cloudwatt.com/project/access_and_security/?tab=access_security_tabs__keypairs_tab)
  * The tools of the trade: [OpenStack CLI](http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/install_clients.html)
  * A local clone of the [Cloudwatt applications](https://github.com/cloudwatt/applications) git repository

### Size of the instance

   By default, the stack deploys on an instance of type "Standard 2" (n1.cw.standard-2). A variety of other instance flavors exist to suit your various needs, allowing you to pay only for the services you need. Instances are charged by the minute and capped at their monthly price (you can find more details on the [Tarifs page](https://www.cloudwatt.com/fr/produits/tarifs.html) on the Cloudwatt website).

   Stack parameters, of course, are yours to tweak at your fancy.

## What will you find in the repository

   Once you have cloned the github, you will find in the `blueprint-coreos-mysql/` repository:

   * `blueprint-coreos-mysql.heat.yml`: HEAT orchestration template. It will be used to deploy the necessary infrastructure.
   * `stack-start.sh`: Stack launching script. This is a small script that will save you some copy-paste.

## Start-up

### Initialize the environment

   Have your Cloudwatt credentials in hand and click [HERE](https://console.cloudwatt.com/project/access_and_security/api_access/openrc/).
   If you are not logged in yet, you will go thru the authentication screen then the script download will start. Thanks to it, you will be able to initiate the shell accesses towards the Cloudwatt APIs.

   Source the downloaded file in your shell. Your password will be requested.

   ~~~ bash
   $ source COMPUTE-[...]-openrc.sh
   Please enter your OpenStack Password:

   ~~~

   Once this done, the Openstack command line tools can interact with your Cloudwatt user account.


### Adjust the parameters

  In the `blueprint-coreos-mysql.heat.yml` file (heat template), you will find a section named `parameters` near the top. The only mandatory parameter is the `keypair_name`. The `keypair_name`'s `default` value should contain a valid keypair with regards to your Cloudwatt user account, if you wish to have it by default on the console.

  Within these heat templates, you can also adjust (and set the defaults for) the instance type by playing with the `flavor_name` parameter accordingly.

  By default, the stack network and subnet are generated for the stack. This behavior can be changed within the `blueprint-coreos-mysql.heat.yml` file as well, if need be, although doing so may be cause for security concerns.

### Start the stack

 In a shell, run the script `stack-start.sh`:

 ~~~ bash
 $ ./stack-start.sh mysql
 +--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------+----------------------+
 | id                                   | stack_name | stack_status       | creation_time        |
 +--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------+----------------------+
 | xixixx-xixxi-ixixi-xiixxxi-ixxxixixi | mysql    | CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | 2025-10-23T07:27:69Z |
 +--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------+----------------------+
 ~~~

 Within 5 minutes the stack will be fully operational. (Use watch to see the status in real-time)

 ~~~ bash
 $ watch -n 1 heat stack-list
 +--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------+
 | id                                   | stack_name | stack_status    | creation_time        |
 +--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------+
 | xixixx-xixxi-ixixi-xiixxxi-ixxxixixi | mysql    | CREATE_COMPLETE | 2025-10-23T07:27:69Z |
 +--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------+
 ~~~

### Enjoy

Once all of this done, stack's description can be obtained with the following command :

 ~~~ bash
 $ heat stack-show mysql
