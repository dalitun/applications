# 5 Minutes Stacks, Episode 14: Graylog

## Episode 14: Graylog

Graylog is an open source log management platform capable of manipulating and presenting data from virtually any source. At it's core, Graylog consists of a 3-tier architecture:

![Graylog Diagram](img/graylog_diagram.png)

* The Graylog Web Interface is a powerful tool that allows anyone to manipulate the entirety of what Graylog has to offer through an intuitive and appealing web application.
* At the heart of Graylog is it's own strong software. Graylog Server interacts with all other components using REST APIs so that each component of the system can be scaled without comprimising the integrity of the system as a whole.
* Real-time search results when you want them and how you want them: Graylog is only able to provide this thanks to the tried and tested power of Elasticsearch. The Elasticsearch nodes behind the scenes give Graylog the speed that makes it a real pleasure to use.

Boasting this impressive architecture as well as a vast library of plugins, Graylog stands as a strong and versatile log management solution.

By following this guide you will deploy a compressed but fully functional version of Graylog: Graylog Web and Server as well as Elasticsearch all deployed on one instance. This is a great way to discover the potential of Graylog and explore it's versatile web UI without expending many resources.

## Preparations

### The version

* Graylog (graylog-server/graylog-web) 1.2.2-1
* Elasticsearch (elasticsearch) 1.7.3
* MongoDB (mongodb-org) 3.0.7

### The prerequisites to deploy this stack

These should be routine by now:

* Internet access
* A Linux shell
* A [Cloudwatt account](https://www.cloudwatt.com/cockpit/#/create-contact) with a [valid keypair](https://console.cloudwatt.com/project/access_and_security/?tab=access_security_tabs__keypairs_tab)
* The tools of the trade: [OpenStack CLI](http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/install_clients.html)
* A local clone of the [Cloudwatt applications](https://github.com/cloudwatt/applications) git repository

### Size of the instance

By default, the stack deploys on an instance of type "Small" (s1.cw.small-1). A variety of other instance types exist to suit your various needs, allowing you to pay only for the services you need. Instances are charged by the minute and capped at their monthly price (you can find more details on the [Tarifs page](https://www.cloudwatt.com/fr/produits/tarifs.html) on the Cloudwatt website).

Stack parameters, of course, are yours to tweak at your fancy.

## What will you find in the repository

Once you have cloned the github repository, you will find in the `bundle-trusty-graylog/` directory:

* `bundle-trusty-graylog.heat.yml`: Heat orchestration template. It will be use to deploy the necessary infrastructure.
* `stack-start.sh`: Stack launching script, which simplifies the parameters and secures the admin password creation.
* `stack-get-url.sh`: Returns the floating-IP in a URL, which can also be found in the stack output.

## Start-up

### Initialize the environment

Have your Cloudwatt credentials in hand and click [HERE](https://console.cloudwatt.com/project/access_and_security/api_access/openrc/).
If you are not logged in yet, complete the authentication and save the credentials script.
With it, you will be able to wield the amazing powers of the Cloudwatt APIs.

Source the downloaded file in your shell and enter your password when prompted to begin using the OpenStack clients.

~~~ bash
$ source COMPUTE-[...]-openrc.sh
Please enter your OpenStack Password:

~~~

Once this done, the Openstack command line tools can interact with your Cloudwatt user account.

### Adjust the parameters

In the `.heat.yml` files (heat templates), you will find a section named `parameters` near the top. The mandatory parameters are the `keypair_name` and the `password` for the Graylog *admin* user.

You can set the `keypair_name`'s `default` value to save yourself time, as shown below.
Remember that key pairs are created [from the console](https://console.cloudwatt.com/project/access_and_security/?tab=access_security_tabs__keypairs_tab), and only keys created this way can be used.

The `password` field provides the password for Graylog's default *admin* user. You will need it upon initial login, but you can always create other users later. You can also adjust (and set the default for) the instance type by playing with the `flavor` parameter accordingly.

By default, the stack network and subnet are generated for the stack, in which the Graylog server sits alone. This behavior can be changed within the `.heat.yml` as well, if needed.

~~~ yaml

### Stack up with a terminal

In a shell, run the script `stack-start.sh`:

~~~ bash
$ ./stack-start.sh TICKERTAPE «my-keypair-name»
Enter your new admin password:
Enter your new password once more:
Creating stack...
+--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------+----------------------+
| id                                   | stack_name | stack_status       | creation_time        |
+--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------+----------------------+
| xixixx-xixxi-ixixi-xiixxxi-ixxxixixi | TICKERTAPE | CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | 2025-10-23T07:27:69Z |
+--------------------------------------+------------+--------------------+----------------------+
~~~

Within 5 minutes the stack will be fully operational. (Use watch to see the status in real-time)

~~~ bash
$ watch -n 1 heat stack-list
+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------+
| id                                   | stack_name | stack_status    | creation_time        |
+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------+
| xixixx-xixxi-ixixi-xiixxxi-ixxxixixi | TICKERTAPE | CREATE_COMPLETE | 2025-10-23T07:27:69Z |
+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+----------------------+
~~~

### Stack URL with a terminal

Once all of this done, you can run the `stack-get-url.sh` script.

~~~ bash
$ ./stack-get-url.sh TICKERTAPE
TICKERTAPE  http://70.60.637.17:9000/
~~~

As shown above, it will parse the assigned floating-IP of your stack into a URL link, with the right port included. You can then click or paste this into your browser of choice and bask in the glory of a fresh Graylog instance.

![Graylog Home](img/graylog_home.png)

<a name="console" />

### Please console me

There there, it's okay... Graylog stacks can be spawned from our console as well!

To create our Graylog stack from the console:

1.	Go the Cloudwatt Github in the [applications/bundle-trusty-graylog](https://github.com/cloudwatt/applications/tree/master/bundle-trusty-graylog) repository
2.	Click on the file named `bundle-trusty-graylog.heat.yml`
3.	Click on RAW, a web page will appear containing purely the template
4.	Save the page to your PC. You can use the default name proposed by your browser (just remove the .txt if needed)
5.  Go to the [Stacks](https://console.cloudwatt.com/project/stacks/) section of the console
6.	Click on **Launch stack**, then **Template file** and select the file you just saved to your PC, and finally click on **NEXT**
7.	Name your stack in the **Stack name** field
8.	Enter the name of your keypair in the **SSH Keypair** field
9.	Enter the password for the default *admin* user
10.	Choose your instance size using the **Instance Type** dropdown and click on **LAUNCH**

The stack will be automatically generated (you can see its progress by clicking on its name). When all modules become green, the creation will be complete. You can then go to the "Instances" menu to find the floating-IP, or simply refresh the current page and check the Overview tab for a handy link.

Remember that the Graylog UI is on port 9000, not the default port 80!

## So watt?

The goal of this tutorial is to accelerate your start. At this point **you** are the master of the stack. The default user is *admin* with the password you set during stack creation. An easy way to [get started](http://docs.graylog.org/en/1.2/pages/getting_started.html#get-messages-in) is to have your Graylog server log itself!

![Graylog Inputs](img/graylog_inputs.png)

Graylog takes inputs from a plethora of ports and protocols, I recommend you take the time to document yourselves on the possibilities. Just remember that all input and output ports must be explicitly set in the stack's [security group](https://console.cloudwatt.com/project/access_and_security/?tab=access_security_tabs__security_groups_tab). To add an input, click on **MANAGE RULES** for your stack's security group and then, once on the page *MANAGE SECURITY GROUP RULES*, click **+ ADD RULE**. If logs don't make it to your graylog instance, check the [security group](https://console.cloudwatt.com/project/access_and_security/?tab=access_security_tabs__security_groups_tab) first!

![Graylog Sources](img/graylog_sources.png)

Once you are receiving logs from a variety of sources, dashboards will certainly become your favorite tool. Search results can be converted into widgets that update in real-time, and dashboards let you organize those widgets into information-rich panels that can give essential visibility on the state of your environment. Take the time to create a dashboard which displays the information you care about, and monitoring your VMs is sure to become a more pleasant experience.

![Graylog Dashboard Example](img/graylog_dashboard.png)

You also now have an SSH access point on your virtual machine through the floating-IP and your private key pair (default user name `cloud`). Be warned, the default browser connection to Graylog is not encrypted (HTTP): if you are using your Graylog instance to store sensitive data, you may want to connect with an SSH tunnel instead.

~~~ bash
user@home$ cd applications/bundle-trusty-graylog/
user@home$ ./stack-get-url.sh TICKERTAPE
TICKERTAPE  http://70.60.637.17:9000/
user@home$ ssh 70.60.637.17 -l cloud -i /path/to/your/.ssh/keypair.pem -L 5000:localhost:9000
[...]
cloud@graylog-server$ █
~~~

By doing the above, I could then access my Graylog server from http://localhost:5000/ on my browser. ^^

## The State of Affairs

This bundle deploys the minimum Graylog setup for use in smaller, non-critical, or test setups. None of the components are redundant but it is resource-light and quick to launch.

![Minimum setup](http://docs.graylog.org/en/1.3/_images/simple_setup.png)

Bigger production environments are much heftier but carry a number of advantages, not least among them being fluid horizontal scaling. This allows Graylog to expand and shrink to meet the current workload. If you are interested in such an environment, check out the link *Graylog architectural considerations* below.
