description: "Minecraft is a game about breaking and placing blocks. Originally a sandbox video game created by Swedish programmer Notch, Minecraft is now developed and published by Mojang. Integrating exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat into a rewarding experience, Minecraft stays fresh through hours of play. Multiplayer provides yet another layer of depth as players band together to create vast structures beyond your imagination."
